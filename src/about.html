                        <p>This site is built in pure HTML and CSS, most of which is rather clean and elegant, but of course there are a few dirty little hacks sneaking around...</p>
                        <p>I've tried to stick with semantic HTML and CSS grid, so things may look weird on unsupported browsers (like Firefox, whoops...)

                        <p>Something else cool to note is that this website is templated - this means that common elements are interpolated into each page for consistency: the header, footer, sidebar, and navbar. Since there is no scripting this is all done at compile-time.</p>
