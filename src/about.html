                        <p>This site is built in pure HTML and CSS, most of which is rather clean and elegant, but of course there are a few dirty little hacks sneaking around...</p>
                        <p>I've tried to stick with semantic HTML and CSS grid, so things may look weird on unsupported browsers.

                        <p>Something else cool to note is that this website makes is compiled &mdash this means that common elements are interpolated into each page for consistency: The header, footer, sidebar, and navbar.</p>
